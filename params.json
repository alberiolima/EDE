EDE was created by analyzing the structure of the byte data of the binary file.\r\n\r\n### Edit&Create\r\nEDE is not just an editor as it can create new files from scratch as well.\r\n\r\n### 100% Correct\r\nEDE will preserve the floating point precision and all other data of the original file. Saving over original file or as new will produce identical to the byte file. EDE is also able to correct some of the errors of the original file as well.\r\n\r\n### Additional Info\r\nEDE provides additional info that will immensely help adjusting the drop rates of the items.\r\n\r\n### Multi-Selection\r\nEDE allows selection and removal of multiple items or monsters at the same time for faster editing and removal of the unwanted entries.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Search\r\nEDE is able to search through all lists for specific monster or item. In case of multiple hits in different lists EDE will not only step through these but also the duplicate entries in the same list.\r\n\r\n### Unicode Support\r\nEDE will load and display correctly the Unicode text and save it with the original character encoding.",

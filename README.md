### Welcome to EDE
EDE is a full blown editor of the server file (extra_drop.sev) that controls the drop rates of items from monsters in a MMORPG game [Perfect World](http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/pwi). EDE was developed in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and by analyzing the structure of the byte data of the binary file.

### Edit&Create
EDE is not just an editor, it can create new .sev files from scratch as well.

### 100% Correct
EDE will preserve the floating point precision and all other data of the original file. Saving as new will produce identical to the byte file. EDE is also able to correct some of the errors of the original file as well.

### Additional Info
EDE provides additional info that will immensely help adjusting the drop rates of the items.

### Multi-Selection
EDE allows selection and removal of multiple items or monsters at the same time for faster editing and removal of the unwanted entries.

### Advanced Search
EDE is able to search through all lists for specific monster or item. In case of multiple hits in different lists EDE will not only step through these but also the duplicate entries in the same list.

### Unicode Support
EDE will load and display correctly the Unicode text and save it with the original character encoding.
